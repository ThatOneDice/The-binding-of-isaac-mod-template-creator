# The-binding-of-isaac-mod-template-creator
A the binding of isaac template creator, pretty much minimal

I learned C all over again just to make this, it was a fun project
, recommended for new isaac modders that dont know how to make these files

I tried my best to make the compiler display as little warnings as possible
, i'll be using this myself as i often get confused for doing the specific stuff this program can do

Before you download, i REALLY suggest you compiling the script with gcc instead of getting the exe file, 
i keep doing mistakes with the code itsself and thats the first thing i edit before posting yet another exe file
