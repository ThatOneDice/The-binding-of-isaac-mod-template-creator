# The-binding-of-isaac-mod-template-creator
A the binding of isaac template creator, pretty much minimal

I learned C all over again just to make this, it was a fun project
Recommended for new isaac modders that dont know how to make these files

I tried my best to make the compiler display as little warnings as possible
I'll be using this myself as i often get confused for doing the specific stuff this program can do
